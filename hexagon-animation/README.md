Write a Python program that shows 5 balls bouncing inside a spinning hexagon. The balls should be affected by gravity and friction, and must bounce off the rotating walls realistically. The balls should collide with each other and the walls. Also add a speed bar where user can control speed of the spinning of hexagon and add ball button, so total ball count can be increased.
