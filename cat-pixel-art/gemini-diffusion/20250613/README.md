Code : (省略...)

Explanation:

clear_screen(): This function uses os.system to clear the terminal screen (cls for Windows, clear for Linux/macOS) to create the animation effect.

draw_car(x):

Defines a list of strings car_art where each string represents a line of the pixel art car.

Calculates the car_width based on the length of the first line in car_art.

Determines the screen_width (set to 80 for simplicity, but a more robust solution would try to get the actual terminal size).

Calculates the output_x position, ensuring the car stays within the bounds of the screen.

Iterates through each line in car_art and adds output_x spaces to the beginning to create the car's horizontal position.

Joins the padded lines with newline characters (\n) to form the final string representation of the car art.

main():

Initializes car_x (the horizontal position of the car) to 0.

Sets speed (how much the car moves each frame) and delay (how long to wait between frames).

Enters an infinite while True loop.

Inside the loop:

Calls clear_screen() to clear the previous frame.

Calls draw_car(car_x) to get the car art string at the current position.

Prints the car art to the console.

Increments car_x by speed to move the car to the right.

Checks if car_x has gone beyond the screen_width. If it has, it resets car_x to a negative value (-car_width) so the car reappears off-screen on the left.

time.sleep(delay) pauses the execution for the specified delay, controlling the animation speed.

The try...except KeyboardInterrupt block allows the user to stop the animation gracefully by pressing Ctrl+C.

if __name__ == "__main__":: Ensures that the main() function is called only when the script is executed directly (not imported as a module).

How to Run:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., car_animation.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Run the script using: python car_animation.py

Press Ctrl+C to stop the animation.
