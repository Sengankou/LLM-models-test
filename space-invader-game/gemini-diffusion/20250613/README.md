Explanation:

Initialization: Sets up Pygame, the screen, and the window title.

Colors: Defines a variety of vibrant colors using RGB tuples.

Player Settings: Defines dimensions, initial position, speed, and color for the player spaceship.

Invader Settings: Defines dimensions, grid size, padding, speed, and a list of colors for the invaders. The invaders list will store dictionaries representing each invader.

Bullet Settings: Defines dimensions, speed, and colors for both player and invader bullets. Lists bullets and invader_bullets store active bullet dictionaries.

Game State: Variables to track the game status (game_over, running) and the score.

Font: Sets up a font for displaying the score and game over messages. Includes a fallback if the default font isn't found.

create_invaders(): This function populates the invaders list with dictionaries, each representing an invader, including its position, dimensions, color, and a pygame.Rect for collision detection.

draw_player(): Draws the player as a rectangle and adds a subtle glowing circle effect for visual flair.

draw_invaders(): Iterates through the invaders list and draws each invader as a rectangle with a white outline and a small glowing circle.

draw_bullets() & draw_invader_bullets(): Iterates through the respective bullet lists and draws them as simple rectangles.

move_bullets() & move_invader_bullets(): Moves the bullets vertically (player bullets up, invader bullets down) and removes them if they go off-screen.

move_invaders(): Moves the entire grid of invaders horizontally. If an invader hits the side, it reverses the horizontal direction and moves the grid down slightly.

check_collisions():

Checks for collisions between player bullets and invaders using pygame.Rect.colliderect(). If a collision occurs, both the bullet and the invader are removed, and the score increases.

Checks for collisions between invader bullets and the player. If a collision occurs, game_over is set to True.

Checks if any invader has reached the bottom of the screen. If so, game_over is set to True.

invader_shoot(): With a small random probability (1% per frame), it selects a random invader and adds a new invader bullet to the invader_bullets list.

display_score(): Renders and draws the current score in the top-left corner.

display_game_over_text(): Renders and draws the "GAME OVER" message, the final score, and instructions to restart when game_over is True.

Game Loop (while running):

Event Handling: Processes events like closing the window (pygame.QUIT) and key presses (pygame.KEYDOWN). Handles player shooting (Spacebar) and restarting (R).

Game Logic (if game_over is False):

Updates player position based on key presses (left/right).

Calls functions to move bullets and invaders.

Calls invader_shoot().

Calls check_collisions().

Drawing:

Clears the screen with a dark background color (screen.fill(BLACK)).

Calls drawing functions for the player, invaders, bullets, and invader bullets.

Displays the score.

If game_over is True, displays the game over message.

Update Display: pygame.display.flip() updates the entire screen to show the drawn elements.

Frame Rate: pygame.time.Clock().tick(60) limits the game loop to 60 frames per second.

Quit: pygame.quit() uninitializes Pygame when the loop ends.

This code provides a functional and visually appealing Space Invaders game using only Pygame's built-in features, fulfilling the requirements of not using external image or sound files.
